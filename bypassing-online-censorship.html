We've already seen it happen in 2021. [In 2019]. In 2020 there were <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/global-5" target="_blank">83 documented shutdowns</a> in the world. A bit down from the <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/02/KeepItOn-2019-report-1.pdf" target="_blank">213 shutdowns that happened in in 2019</a>, but still on the upward trajectory. There were 33 in 2018 and 25 the year before that.</p><p>I'll be moving on to include some resources on other kinds of internet censorship and how to work around it. The goal overall is to keep it end-user focused, though may add a post on the bigger, more involved projects. The other goal is to experiment with a pretty easy and sturdy way of publishing on the web.</p><h3 id="what-the-detour-is-made-with">What 'The Detour' is made with...</h3><p>As I've noted in earlier posts on this blog, I'm interested in simple, sturdy and secure ways to publish online. Sites that don't need databases or login credentials. Site's with minimal code bases to maintain. I'm publishing this site using Publii and Github pages. The work happens through an app on my computer and then spits pages at a site hosted on Github. So The Detour is an experiment along these lines.</p><p>I'm a <a href="https://standardnotes.org/" target="_blank">Standard Notes</a> user. It's an extendable, open source text editor that's good for taking quick notes, editing, and storing information. It's open source, and can sync across devices and back-up in the cloud of your choice with strong encryption. I&nbsp;recently noticed that it has a simple blogging function that publishes on&nbsp;<a href="https://listed.to/" target="_blank">Listed.to</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not an incredibly sophisticated publishing tool, but really easy for anyone to start, and the model is incredibly attractive if you wanted to extend it to a small team who could submit, review edit and publish using Standard Notes already existing encrypted sharing functions. It's much better than leaving unfinished drafts on a public website, or having to keep persistent connections to a web server while doing the research, writing and editing.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 20 February 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://treacherous.tech/circumvention/">circumvention</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://treacherous.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://treacherous.tech/time-to-read.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Time to read</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://treacherous.tech/this-is-how-they-tell-me-the-world-ends.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Review: &#x27;This is How They Tell Me The World Ends&#x27; </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://treacherous.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Watch this space!</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://treacherous.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
