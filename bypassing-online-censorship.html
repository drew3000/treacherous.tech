It's currently got some information around technology that can help during an Internet Shutdown, since that's been some focus of conversation over the last week following the military coup in Myanmar, and the shutdown that happened there. But internet shutdowns are on the rise, so wanted to start with some posts on that.</p><p>I'll be moving on to include some resources on other kinds of internet censorship and how to work around it. The goal overall is to keep it end-user focused, though may add a post on the bigger, more involved projects.</p><p>I'm a <a href="https://standardnotes.org/" target="_blank">Standard Notes</a> user, and recently noticed that it has a simple blogging function that publishes on&nbsp;<a href="https://listed.to/" target="_blank">Listed.to</a>. This is a great way for simple, offline writing and editing and then pushing the results you're happy with to a live site. I'm very interested in these methods of no-database, secure workflow publishing models. There's very little need to touch the internet until you're ready to publish something, as opposed to typical the typical set up you'd see in Wordpress, Drupal, Django or others that lump the front-end and administration parts of your website in one, easily attackable location by default. It's not an incredibly sophisticated publishing tool, but really easy for anyone to start, and the model is incredibly attractive if you wanted to extend it to a small team who could submit, review edit and publish using Standard Notes already existing encrypted sharing functions. It's much better than leaving unfinished drafts on a public website, or having to keep persistent connections to a web server while doing the research, writing and editing.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 14 February 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://treacherous.tech/circumvention/">circumvention</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://treacherous.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://treacherous.tech/time-to-read.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Time to read</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Watch this space</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://treacherous.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
