It's painful how slow it is. Today, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2023/an-update-on-two-factor-authentication-using-sms-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon has announced that Twitter</a> is going to turn off SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for everyone but Twitter Blue users. 2FA is that second line of defence on your online account. When you log in on a new device or in a new location, or just maybe every 30 days or so, you need to type in a set of numbers after logging in with your username and password. Some people use SMS text messages to receive these. Others use an app like <a href="https://authy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authy</a> or <a href="https://googleauthenticator.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Authenticator</a>. Some people use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YubiKey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical security key</a>.</p><p>There's always a debate raging among Information Security types about which form of 2FA is better, and I'm not even going to get into that because it's pointless. You should use 2FA on every online account you have. That's it. That's the advice. Platforms should provide every diverse type of 2FA available that they can. Any 2FA is better than no 2FA. it's the most effective way of stopping your account from being taken over by someone somewhere else. Anyone getting your password will not be able to login without it.</p><ul><li><strong>SMS:</strong> Sends you a text message with often a 6-digit code. Works on any phone, including a dumb phone. May not work if you're not where you have a connection to a mobile network. In some rare cases someone may hijack your SMS (the feds, and advanced hacker targeting you specifically) and grab your code. They'll also need to know your username and password for it to work.</li><li><strong>Authenticator Apps:</strong> These operate locally on a smartphone and generate 2FA codes. Slightly more secure for not needing networks, and even if you're out of range or have no mobile network access or data, it will still work. If you lose your mobile or it breaks or runs out of battery, then now 2FA for you. If someone steals your unlocked mobile, they can then get into accounts using your 2FA.</li><li><strong>Physical security keys:</strong> these are little plastic things, often looking like a cheap USB stick. You have to insert them into your device, like you would unlock your house with a key. Often these are considered the most secure. Don't lose it or break it.</li><li><strong>Paper backup codes:</strong> This may sound pretty basic, but you can get backup 2FA codes from a lot of online platforms and just save them somewhere. Maybe print them. They only work once, but if you lose your phone or don't have a mobile signal, they can work in a pinch. Just don't keep them on your desk or pinned on the wall behind you during television interviews or conference calls on Teams.</li></ul><p>Most people would suggest you have a couple of backup methods in case one of them fails. Some people don't have access to some of these methods. Maybe you're in a country where a service won't send SMS messages. Maybe your country's government won't let you download an authenticator app and it's banned. Maybe it's illegal where you are to order or buy a physical security key, or the companies just don't operate or ship to where you are or accept payments from there. The world is complicated.</p><p>You could also assess your own security needs and decide which options to use or not use. Maybe you'd rather receive SMS messages on some other mobile, and don't trust people around you. Maybe you'd rather never receive an SMS code, because you're fairly certain the regime where you live has told your mobile service provider to intercept your messages. Maybe you're some hot shot investigative journalist or human rights activist. Or some criminal mastermind. Most of us just don't want to be victims of credit card fraud or something pedestrian like that. A few people lead more interesting lives and their threat model is different from yours. I spend some of my time with those people (no, not the criminals, the other ones). So when Elon shuts off security options for them, it's more than a little annoying.</p><p>My people sometimes need SMS 2FA codes and they can't get Yubikeys or download the authenticator app, and they can't buy Twitter Blue. And they shouldn't have to. By doing this, Elon is asserting that Twitter is not really a global platform, that some users are not equal to others, and that people who want to use it will need to consider being less secure.</p><p>Twitter users have had some problems with 2FA since Elon took over. <a href="https://mezha.media/en/2022/12/13/twitter-has-broken-two-factor-authentication-for-ukrainian-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In December</a>, Twitter had for a short time stopped sending Ukrainian users two-factor authentication codes over SMS. Elon bizarrely blamed it on his war with bots. It made no sense. Anyway, Twitter is no a little bit less secure than it was before. And it will continue to go that way. I won't tell people to stop using it, but be careful on there. It doesn't have your back.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 18 February 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://treacherous.tech/2fa/">2fa</a></li><li><a href="https://treacherous.tech/twitter/">twitter</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://treacherous.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://treacherous.tech/compartmentalization-is-good-for-you.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Compartmentalisation is good for you </a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Watch this space!</p><p>Find me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@aiefel">Mastodon</a>!</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://treacherous.tech/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
