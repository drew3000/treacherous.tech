            "content_html": "<p>With Elon destroying Twitter, a lot of people are looking to up their online social life elsewhere and it seems Mastodon's decentralised 'fediverse' is where they are parachuting. Most are still keeping their Twitter accounts alive until the bitter end, but as the horde moves, there are some people who are finding the experience of life on a largely volunteer run network based on free open source software maintained by a German nonprofit kind of different. I've got a longer blog post coming, but thought I'd dash in some (rough) notes that are hanging around my screen for now. (Also so I can close some tabs).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2022/11/21/we-joined-mastodon-heres-what-we-learned-about-privacy-and-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Markup</a> has a very good break down of what life is like on a Mastodon server, read it. It covers many issues you'll want to consider before joining.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/mastodon-private-and-secure-lets-take-look\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Electronic Frontier Foundation has given a very close look</a> at the security issues around Mastodon as a platform and as a decentralised \"fediverse.\" Read that, too.</li>\n<li>If you're considering hosting a Mastodon community yourself, my only suggestion is to think about it really carefully. And then think again. Go for a walk, have a lay down. Then, aside from the technical piece of running a social network effectively and securely, read this <a href=\"https://denise.dreamwidth.org/91757.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide to potential liability pitfalls for people running a Mastodon instance</a>.</li>\n<li>Here's a good <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmasnick/status/1594575441276248064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter thread</a> on the difficulties of moderation. Imo, people are jumping over to Mastodon with the expectation of being treated like customers. There is no commercial component to it. You are not a customer. People are not doing this for work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is not one Mastodon, but many. It's a federation and anyone can host one but not all are created equal. The whole \"just choose any server\" UX needs work. There are nutter Mastodons out there. Dodgy ones, too. There are also a number of fairly friendly ones. Twitter is/was a centralised commercial service currently under control of an erratic, billionaire man baby. Mastodon platforms are run by all sorts. I don't think any of them are billionaires. They may have other issues.</p>\n<p>Trolls, bots, harassment and abuse are in the fediverse as well. Mastodon doesn't solve the moderation problem, it shifts it and creates strange new quandaries. Instead of the central dictator, you have fiefdoms, some with their petty tyrants, others with inconsistent or corrupt policing, and many seemingly with no sheriff in town at all. Still others have structures with reasonable user expectations and volunteers who do look like they are trying to get it right.</p>\n<p>That's not to make light of serious matters. Abuse, threats, attacks, creepy guys sending unsolicited dick pics, attempts at blackmail, and other horrors I won't even list here are serious, and need to be treated seriously. And I'd argue a lot of commerical platforms also don't take them as seriously as they should, but arguably a small scrappy band of volunteer mods on an open source platform are far less resourced to do it. I encourage reporting these people, outing them and using public humiliation, and any relatively safe avenues of vigilanteism that ruins them, but the reality is that they prey on fear and embarrassment. It's a community problem that needs community support. That's not a conclusive answer to the problem, but I don't think I have one. I don't think any one person has one.</p>\n<p>Mastodon isn't private. There is no end-to-end encryption, but there really isn't on a lot of other services you use, too. I would be careful of what I posted there. You can DM someone but this stands for Direct Message, not Private Message. Any one with administrator access can view all your content. I don't like that the DM button includes an icon of a padlock, as people often associate that with encrypted messaging. There isn't any. If you want to keep the content of your conversation private, you need to use something with end-to-end encryption. Signal. Wire. Matrix. Element. Briar. Even WhatsApp. Take that conversation somewhere else. I would say the same thing about Twitter DMs. A lot of people don't realise what service administers have access to. </p>\n<p>I'm not new to the fediverse, but have been absorbed by watching it suddenly grow. Hope it works, expect many fiery crashes along the way. It's not commercial. There is no manager to talk to. You're not going to a restaurant, but to a pot luck. Keep track of your casserole dish.</p>\n<p>A lot of people come over to a Mastodon platform, and what they see first is what's missing. There's no algorithm studying you to figure out what you might want to see. Some things they were used to Twitter doing for them don't exist. Remember, Twitter is/was a multi-billion dollar business that (Even with all the layoffs and quitting) still has thousands of employees.  Mastodon is run by people doing so largely in their spare time for free, because they believe in it, on servers they pay for out of their own pockets.</p>\n<p>I want Mastodon, or something like it, to win. I want free open source software to win. I want decentralised, community run systems to win. But to win, it has to be accessible, usable, secure, and inviting to everyone. There are a number of problems with it, which I hope to get to in another post. But it does at least seek to offer an alternative model. For those who don't like Big Tech, surveillance capitalist business models, and all of that stuff, go live in the other world for a while. Set fire to your ideas of finding some kind of internet utopia in the process. The world is trade-offs, and nothing is permanent. Maybe you like it and maybe you don't. The worst that probably happens is you delete another account.</p>",

Typical to the regime's violent response to the protests, it is also ramping up its already aggressive online censorship. I'm dropping a couple of things here that someone with a computer or internet server can do to help people in the country maintain access to secure digital communication tools and both access or publish information online.</p>\n<h3>Help maintain access to the Tor Network</h3>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info msg--highlight \"><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Easy.</p>\n<p>If you use either the Chrome or Firefox Browser, you can quickly set up and run <a href=\"Snowflake helps make the Tor Network faster and more useable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snowflake</a>. This helps create Tor relays for users of The Tor Browser, creating faster more useable access. The Tor Network helps defeat censorship by bouncing traffic through servers in a way that evades blocking and also helps improve a user's ability to protect their privacy and stay anonymous, and more secure online. There are a number of ways to set up Tor relays, but Snowflake is pretty easy.<a href=\"https://snowflake.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can get it for <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/torproject-snowflake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firexfox here</a>.</li>\n<li>You can get it for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snowflake/mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chrome here</a>.</li>\n<li>Or, you can just leave this page open in a tab on your web browser, turn on the widget at the bottom of this post, and just let it run.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Snowflake is super easy, and low-bandwidth. You're computer is supporting relay nodes, not exit traffic, and there is no connection to you or the users on the Tor Network or what they do. You do get a nifty statistic to see how many users you're browser plugin has helped in the last 24 hours. So far today (as of this writing), mine has helped 18 people reach some destination over Tor.</p>\n<p><em>If you feel like geeking out, have some system administration skills, and want to do something more involved, you can run a server with it's <a href=\"https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/snowflake/standalone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">own stand-alone Snowflake instance</a>, or <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/new-guide-running-tor-relay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">run a Tor relay server</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Run a Signal proxy</h3>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> Medium.</p>\n<p>The Iranian government is blocking connections to Signal servers. Signal is a secure, end-to-end communications app used by journalists, activists, political figures, and maybe your mom. It has a number of privacy supporting features aside from the encryption, such as disappearing messages. You should use it. You should help people where it's blocked use it, too. Signal has create an open source proxy server set up, that helps create bridges that bypass the blockade. </p>\n<p>for this one, you should be comfortable in the command line, and be able to run an always-on internet server, though it can be a pretty small one. <a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/run-a-proxy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here's more on how to run one</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Run Snowflake in your browser</h3>\n<p>Turn this on, and leave this tab open in your browser, and it will help users on the Tor Browser get more relay bridges to access the web and bypass censorship.</p>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://snowflake.torproject.org/embed.html\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div></p>",

I have more enthusiasm to relaunch the site on a new platform than I do to actually write anything on it. It's more of just a presence. An address. A place to let the world know I'm still tenuously interested in contact. Now, here are some things...</p>\n<h3>Book</h3>\n<p>in book news, I've just finished '<a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/309409/the-new-breed-by-darling-kate/9780241352991\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New Breed</a>', by Kate Darling. In it, Kate looks at how we talk about robots and to a lesser extent but very related, machine learning and artificial intelligence, as robotic machines become... smarter. The idea is that humans think about it wrong. We anthropomorphise the machines and look at them as some kind of emerging other human, either as a companion, competitor, villain or tragic hero. In fact they're tools that move around. And humans have a history of these, namely, animals and our relationship with them. If we wanted to make better analogies, we should look at the history of humans partnering with animals with both positive and less desirable outcomes.</p>\n<p>Thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it. Most of my nonfiction tech reading looks like the source material for an episode of Black Mirror. Even this site's domain is inspired by the more darker side of technology's potential. I'm more often a Debbie Downer: How will it go wrong? How will it be weaponised? What stupid applications will capitalist industry make of something that could be revolutionary in better hands? You may even get to thinking that for someone who self-applies the job title \"technologist\" this guy doesn't really like it that much. And that would be wrong. In fact, I like a lot of the things that society is most afraid of. I love the big data, the algorithms, the AI, and machine learning models. I'm even okay reading a blockchain white paper, even if it's to once again see how it's a rubbish solution for a problem that may not even exist. And I enjoy a good robot. I even like those <a href=\"https://www.bostondynamics.com/products/spot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BostonDynamics robot dogs</a> that freak people out. I draw the line at <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/28/23282023/dead-spiders-robot-grippers-necrobotics-research-rice-university\">necrobotic spiders</a>, though.</p>\n<p>The issue with autonomous machines are the same as with any technology. It's the humans. Scare stories about robotic doom land about weekly. Recently there was the news about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/24/chess-robot-grabs-and-breaks-finger-of-seven-year-old-opponent-moscow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the chess-playing robot that broke the finger of its seven-year-old human opponent</a>. \"Moscow incident occurred because child ‘violated’ safety rules by taking turn too quickly, says official\" the article's subheading read. This is of course, ridiculous, but it's not far unlike the story that appears in 'The New Breed' about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/02/robot-kills-worker-at-volkswagen-plant-in-germany\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">worker killed by a robot arm</a> when he went into the space the robot arm operated, and isn't unlike the stories of Amazon's robot  workers (who are meant to mix with human work environments) that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54355803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">occasionally injure one of the humans working alongside them</a>. What's interesting in these stories is that at some point, someone will say the worker, or child chess player, broke a rule (and so suffered the consequences). In the zeal to deflect liability, you end up with corporate hacks who sounds robotic themselves. In fact, it's a failure of design and appropriate use case. The point is, we've been around autonomous non-human workers, companions, for our entire history: animals, and arguably already more sentient and intelligent than even the most sophisticated AI running today. </p>\n<p>It's important to think about now. We should define the tools around us before they're defined for us. It's not difficult to imagine how wrong that can go without thinking of The Terminator or the Matrix or boo-scary scenarios that imagine robot brains operating roughly like human brains do: meaning they want to fuck everything up asap. We currently have policymakers that don't even understand the basics of internet security <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/22/british_encryption_scanning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">and yet make annual attempts to break it</a>. The world is moving fast, and things are breaking. I can't keep up.</p>\n<h3>Web Browser plugin</h3>\n<p>We all hate those GDPR-mandated \"consent\" pop-ups that plague the web, even if many of us can appreciate the idea that we should get to opt-in/out of pervasive tracking. A number of web platforms have gone the passive-aggressive route that complies with the letter of the law, while making the decisions and controls as opaque or complicated as possible, unless you just want to quickly select \"yes\" and ignore what you've agreed to. Most people do that. Anyone surfing the web has not time for that madness, and if you're doing actual work, these consent forms are adding on hours. The open source project, <a href=\"https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consent-O-Matic</a> aims to address that.</p>\n<p>Works on Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers. You can install it, set your preferences in the plugin settings, and then it fills out those forms in seconds when you visit the websites. It doesn't work on every one, but most larger sites use common 3rd party GDPR-consent form providers or a framework the plugin is designed to recognise. And you get the joy of watching it quickly fill out everything in a small window and disappear while you get on with reading your article. This is a reasonable hack until websites just start designing their cookies to not be intrusive and just respect privacy by default (and then not need GDPR opt-in forms).</p>\n<h3>Shows</h3>\n<p>Caught Channel 4's '<a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-undeclared-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Undeclared War</a>' and found it to be a mixed bag, attempting to do too much in not enough episodes. Essentially set in GCHQ it follows a series of cyber attacks between Russia and UK with a sort of \"grounded-in-reality\" approach. I don't think a work placement person would see this much action, really. Also, in trying to ground itself in reality it dates itself too quickly, taking place after the show's fictitious prime minister ousts Boris Johnson in a leadership contest. All the attacks are plausible, but not nearly at this rate. And adding some family drama and a go-nowhere unresolved romance just muddled it further. There is still a good cyber war film or show to be made, and this one isn't quite it.</p>",

I have no idea.</p>\n<p>The Spotify story just keeps on giving. What's neat about it is how many cultural zeitgeists and trends are mashed in a single event. We've got capitalism vs. social responsibility, science literacy vs ignorance, the cult of celebrity, the belief in consumer choice as a source of political and social activism, platform terms of service being substituted as the law of the land on regulating free speech, data rights, privacy, creator control and fair compensation, copyright, and etc. etc. etc. It's all here. The world will burn to an algorithmically generated playlist.</p>\n<p>Since Spotify decided to go with Joe Rogan's podcast over Neil Young's music in Young's ultimatum over the talk show's repeated amplifying of pandemic and vaccine misinformation, <a href=\"https://mediatraffic.org/2022/01/29/spotify-loses-4-billion-in-market-value-after-neil-young-controversy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the platform's market value has lost $4 billion</a>.

Spotify has a good user interface. The algorithm is also fairly decent at pitching tunes I'll likely enjoy. For the WFH years of this pandemic, it really was in the background a lot of the time, as I assume it had been for a lot of people. I don't think it's a coincidence that Spotify's value surged as more people were cut off from the outside world, sort of like how the plague times helped Amazon. And again, no one paid attention to the fact that Joe Rogan had a platform there until Spotify decided it was worth paying him $100 million to quit Apple Music and any other platform. So, all around, the teachable lesson here is that platforms should let creators upload where they want, and instead compete for them via better compensation models instead of high-stake gambling of exclusivity.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://treacherous.tech/media/posts/19/Napster_running_on_an_original_iBook_2001-03-11.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://treacherous.tech/media/posts/19/responsive/Napster_running_on_an_original_iBook_2001-03-11-xs.png 300w ,https://treacherous.tech/media/posts/19/responsive/Napster_running_on_an_original_iBook_2001-03-11-sm.png 480w ,https://treacherous.tech/media/posts/19/responsive/Napster_running_on_an_original_iBook_2001-03-11-md.png 768w ,https://treacherous.tech/media/posts/19/responsive/Napster_running_on_an_original_iBook_2001-03-11-lg.png 1024w ,https://treacherous.tech/media/posts/19/responsive/Napster_running_on_an_original_iBook_2001-03-11-xl.png 1360w ,https://treacherous.tech/media/posts/19/responsive/Napster_running_on_an_original_iBook_2001-03-11-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"The official Napster client runs on an original iBook running Mac OS 9.

Napster, Limewire, and a load of other pre-web services allowed for decentralised and ubiquitous file sharing. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica_v._Napster,_Inc.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metalica</a> may not have liked it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2007/12/08/50-cent-file-sharing-doesn%e2%80%99t-hurt-artists/?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIc1b995LotsgzT0RScovBEP0mzTxAHXMCQSKKu83k_wTmrEevrqxTkAh8YfsDD3hg5nEEg_RNyvOn5f4QIo8_uoHB1RZJfP_y6ZxToKgo-aaSckQ-VkkROHbVnlBF-RQ2y2CpO3DSsyvV1GO5PChEv6yHajGhNBSU1NcyKch5JI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">but it was good for others</a> in getting attention and interest in their live gigs. Performers didn't really win in the copyright wars. Listeners certainly didn't. We had all these great running between apps, decentralised, networks of fans, running FTP hosts or being torrent seeders (still around to some extent).</p>\n<p>What this isn't really about is free speech, though it works in Spotify's interests to frame it that way. It of course has the legal right to host Rogan and any other podcaster it likes. It doesn't have the right to demand market value, subscribers or people looking at their ads. Free speech protection is not about the right to profits.</p>\n<p>Related, but at a lower volume, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/27/anti-vaxxers-making-at-least-25m-a-year-from-publishing-on-substack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">e-newsletter service Substack came under fire last week</a> over the hight volume of anti-vaccine pundits are using its service to reach and grow their audiences. Apparently, these content creators have earned a combine $2.5 milion a year from their Substack subscribers. Now, who know's how may of these wingnuts there are and how much of that amount each is getting. I imagine there are a few bigger voices taking the most of it and then some fringe of the fringe group getting the rest. But Substack gets a percentage of that whole amount, so it's definitely profiting off of covid-29 disinformation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://on.substack.com/p/society-has-a-trust-problem-more?r=1im5e&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Substack's says</a> it doesn't do content moderation and respects free speech. It's a different situation to Spotify in one very key way: Substack is not buying these people exclusively for its platform. It's not giving a writer several million dollars to just publish on Substack. These writers have kind of an equal footing as any other content creator on Substack. I actually don't think Substack should \"censor\" content creators either, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/substack-launches-defender-a-program-offering-legal-support-to-independent-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Substack does seem to put some money</a> behind it's free speech mantra.</p>\n<p>Still, in its own blog post defending its policy, there are a <span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">lot of concepts muddled together, essentially to protect a a business model. Substack is a vanity press. That's fine. The internet runs on them. It's not countering society's \"trust problem\" with the media. The trust problem is not a free speech problem, it's a media literacy problem. In many ways, Substack works against solving the trust problem, it provides a platform for people to bypass the public scrutiny that builds credibility. At the end of the day, it's an e-newsletter tool. It's hip MailChimp. You know that line \"politics is show business for ugly people,\" right? Exchange \"politics\" with Substack and \"show business\" with Onlyfans. That's Substack. <a href=\"https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/anti-vaxxers-qanon-influencers-and-white-nationalists-flocking-to-substack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This is why</a> it gets the anti-vaxxes, the QAnons, and the White Nationalists. Not sure how that builds trust. </span></p>\n<p>At the center of all of this is the commodity of providing a platform or infrastructure that allows others to express themselves. This then becomes a set of business decisions, mundane, boring and based on bottom lines. Substack, Spotify, Facebook, or whatever other commercial platforms you want to include here are not advocacy organisations. They exist to monetise human behaviours. There are things people want to do on the web, and they exist to facilitate that to turn a profit, through subscriptions, ads, monetising user data or whatever else can be thought of. So long as the free speech protection debate is muddled with profit motives of content platforms, it will be defined as whatever happens to be in the best interest of business, which can always change. Platform terms of service are a horrible substitute for good laws and protection of rights.</p>\n<div class=\"css-1dbjc4n\">\n<div id=\"id__znxag5kkn\" class=\"css-1dbjc4n\" aria-labelledby=\"id__78yjugh30ik id__9e7153902bm\">\n<div class=\"css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4\">\n<div id=\"id__9e7153902bm\" class=\"css-1dbjc4n r-1ets6dv r-1867qdf r-1phboty r-rs99b7 r-1ny4l3l r-1udh08x r-o7ynqc r-6416eg\" aria-labelledby=\"id__ocpzqgcu5bg id__les79acjiqo\" data-testid=\"card.wrapper\">\n<div id=\"id__ocpzqgcu5bg\" class=\"css-1dbjc4n r-140t1nj r-pm2fo r-zmljjp r-rull8r r-qklmqi r-1adg3ll\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-testid=\"card.layoutLarge.media\">\n<div class=\"css-1dbjc4n r-1adg3ll r-1udh08x\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "content_html": "<p>Here it is Friday after work, and I am without an obligatory Spotify playlist filling the background while settling into the dubious plan of attempting to write something on the blog.  Why? because I canceled my Spotify family plan and logged out of the account, and when time allows I'll export my mess of playlists elsewhere and delete it. Why? Because Neil Young (whose music I do enjoy but admittedly rarely listen to) has pulled his work from the platform. Why? Because Spotify paid $100 million to exclusively host a sketchy podcast series hosted by this guy Joe Rogan, who regularly puts out dodgy information about our current pandemic. I also don't really listen to Joe Rogan, and the scant bits and pieces I've heard of his show reaffirm that lifestyle choice. It's a dumpster fire of nonsense. So considering that the current drama is between two people I don't spend much time on, why would I close an account based on it? Let me explain, gentle reader, while listening to Reykjavík's own <a href=\"http://radio.garden/listen/apparatidj/3Kv37fX2\" title=\"Can someone explain why this site has no https?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apparatið radio</a> on <a href=\"http://radio.garden\" title=\"I enjoy this site, but if you switch to another browser tab it quits.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">radio.garden</a>.</p>\n<p>As is this blog's policy, we're not going to go through the whole background of this story. It's all over the media, so go find it. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22900437/neil-young-spotify-joe-rogan-vaccine-misinformation\" title=\"Go on, get the facts before my self indulgent ruminations. I'll wait. I got all night. \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find it here</a>. So you might think this story is about dangers of misinformation (disinformation if you think there's strategic intent to deceive), and there's surely elements of that here. Thousands of people are continuing to dro Spotify as I write this and maybe even as you read it (depending on when you're doing that)  for choosing misinformation grifter Joe Rogan over a principled rock icon Neil Young. They are proudly tweeting, facebooking or redditing that they'd jumped over to Apple Music, TIDAL, Bandcamp, and and so on because Spotify is platforming a dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy nutter.</p>\n<p>If that's the case, they're all in for a shock. Rogan left Apple Music not because he got booted out. Spotify just spent heaps of moola for exclusive rights to his show, that's all. Apple was fine with him being there and there's plenty of other legacy Rogan stuff still on its platform. And if you're worried about nutters having a right wing nutters and fascists having a voice, Apple hosts <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bannons-war-room/id1485351658\" title=\"Steve Bannon is far worse than Joe Rogan. Rogan is just a narcissist. Bannon has a vision.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steve Bannon</a>'s show. I don't know if you can find antisemitic, anti-science podcast TruNews on Apple Music, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trunews/id880594743\" title=\"Far more insane than Joe Rogan can hope to be.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">but you can find it on its iPhone app store</a>. The point: <span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">A bit of searching and you'll find something sketchy on any of the platforms.</span></p>\n<p>I don't think Rogan needs to be \"deplatformed\" or \"canceled\" or whatever the boomers are alleging the kids call it these days. The government isn't — and certainly shouldn't — censor him. I know some people do think he should be. I think they're wrong, and anyway, it's not going to happen. That word gets thrown around a lot, but censorship is not people deciding to go somewhere else when you're talking. That's just them telling you you're not worth their time. Censorship requires a structure aimed at silencing particular points of view. If you don't get paid for your views, that's not censorship. I've got this whole blog no one's paying for. Millions of people do. Censorship also requires power asymmetry (power, money, access to control regulation, etc.) I can't google any results of weaker parties successfully censoring more powerful or dominant groups. Celebrities aren't censored by audiences who have grown tired of them.</p>\n<p>What people are attempting is a boycott, which is actually just more free speech. Neil Young wanted Spotify to choose between his music and Rogan's podcasts after <a href=\"https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/\">an open letter</a> to Spotify, signed by hundreds of doctors, asked the platform to implement a misinformation policy following Rogan's show featured a guest promoting various anti-vaccine conspiracies. It's not the only time that's happened. Spotify, in response, removed Young's music. So that's its misinformation policy.</p>\n<p>It's important (central, even) to this story that Spotify bought exclusive rights to Rogan's show, and made this choice. It indicates that Rogan's content is part of Spotify's business model. A $100 million bet that a show that occasionally dabbles paranoid conspiracies that put people off life-saving vaccines is not an accident. This comes after another piece of weird news in which Spotify paid $30 million to royal exiles Harry and Meg for a show <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/spotify-steps-in-to-bolster-meghan-and-harrys-multimilliondollar-podcast/news-story/550810c42d28be3d8f486e1433243574\" title=\"I would not make a podcast for half that amount.\" rel=\"nofollow\">they subsequently never made</a>. And all this spending resurfaced the fact that Spotify <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Spotify#Allegations_of_unfair_artist_compensation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pays most artists horribly</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spotify-comedy-royalties-faceoff-1235135127/\">wiped a bunch of content of comedians</a> who complained they hadn't been paid, and essentially just being a shitty business <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotify-has-finally-found-a-profitable-tune-51635346820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that's only managed to show a profit in September</a> due to its ad revenues.</p>\n<p>So, considering the investment in douche podcasters, treating the majority of content creators horribly, I decided I didn't need to pay into that. And since I was only paying to not hear the ads, I've got no use case for Spotify. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">So importantly, boycotters: It's not enough to stop your subscriptions. If you want things to hit Spotify's wallet you need to close your account.</span> </strong>Spotify avoided being in the red by the skin of its teeth and it was due to ads, not your subscriptions, and that's based on accounts and their activity. That's not censorship. Consider all the things you didn't listen to today. All those radio shows you missed, all those dramas you didn't watch because you didn't have the time or they looked stupid. You didn't censor any of them.</p>\n<p>That's the good news. Now here's the bad news: The streaming industry sucks. Aside from <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bandcamp</a>, which is limited, there are no real good actors out there. So, you're still going to find on lots of them the horrible payment schemes, the bad podcasters and the ravenous, destructive, snake-eating-its-tale capitalism. That's because the music industry is itself awful, a subset of the exploitative entertainment industry. You can decide to boycott it all, but that may get kind of a grim, and it just means the people who may not be getting paid their worth are making even less.</p>\n<p>So choose, but as DJ Gandalf says, choose wisely. Maybe pick a service that's not spending millions of dollars for exclusive rights to elevate hateful trolls and flat-earthers. Just remember that their existence is a whack-a-mole problem that spans all platforms of any decent size, and the mitigation needed is in education and better access to good information, and the sorts of social investment that don't create nihilistic hordes braying for an apocalypse that would be preferable to their wretched, vacuous existence and so are prime to believe anyone willing to tell them that sweet, sweet doom is finally happening. Carpet baggers are nothing new, and they've always known how to make a buck. The best you can hope for is a platform not going out of its way to turn them into multi-millionaires.</p>\n<p>And now here's more bad news: We gave our freedom away, or let it be dragged away. And I'm talking about file formats, interpretability, the right to copy your own media and use it anywhere you want. While everyone's chirping their happiness of switching to Apple Music, the voice in the back of my head still holds Apple more than a little responsible for this mess. When it went down the DRM route in iTunes, it was a step towards the streaming world. Along the way we lost mixtapes and burned CDs or MP3s that could be moved from this to that device regardless of who made it or what software it's running.</p>\n<p>The first format I bought with my own money was vinyl. I think I was in the 5th grade give or take a year, I had a couple of dollars at a garage sale up the road from home and picked up Janis Joplin's \"Cheap Thrills.\" Had no idea what was going in in that, just taken by the Robert Crumb cover art., but obviously someone bought the album, and now was being resold. My sister and I still debate who's album that one actually belonged to, but it was mine. The thing about records is that they're not terribly portable.</p>\n<p>File format evolution has been about shrinking things and making them portable. Vinyl was good for visual artists, and as formats got smaller they lost out, until most people were just looking at thumbnail images. During that transition, there was a brief, sweet spot for music fans between cassette tapes and burnable CDs, and then the early file sharing. But then the more copiable and digitised and intangible music became, more musicians started losing out. There's a whole history in this period on battles over intellectual property, copyright reform, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">even a political movement I was keen on for a while</a>. Some good ideas started fermenting around that time and still exist, such as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creative Commons</a>. But it taught the music industry new tricks. Criminalise uncontrolled file sharing and lower the cost barriers of file access, and also don't really still give that much cash back to content creators. Shrinking things has profit. Portability, not so much. Now the industry isn't even about purchasing the music files, just accessing them in lease contracts on specific apps in which whenever you complete a track some lucky performer somewhere you'll never pay to see live because of a pandemic will get $0.0033. Meanwhile, profits the platform suck in from your $10 per month will help it throw bags of cash at of some fuckwit you never listen to whose only skill is preying on the simple minded and the angry.</p>\n<p>So, I'll probably make another Faustian bargain on some other service. You won't hear which one it is until I quit that one too, though. I'll give one free advertising when there's a good creator controlled service.</p>\n<p><strong>&gt; Find more random thoughts on all this <a href=\"https://treacherous.tech/some-more-notes-on-the-spotify-kerfuffle.html\">here</a>.</strong></p>",

This time it's with an costly and fairly lewd (more on that shortly) public relations blitz aimed at reframing an important but usually invisible security configuration as something akin to a pervy booth at the back of a nude dancing club instead of, say, the function that keeps your banking details, medical records, important business and personal communications confined to just those you think should see them.</p>\n<p>In this instalment of the Very British Crypto Wars, Priti Patel's team has signed a £534,000 contract with advertising firm M&amp;C Saatchi to reframe backdooring your security away from being a privacy or security concern to make it \"about the children\" and the notion that encryption is keeping police from tackling child exploitation online. This is also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57050689\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not the first time to use fly that flag</a>. The Home Office is also working with longtime alley in this battle, the still very misguided NSPCC, which still campaigns that children will be safer only if their communications are some how easer to exploit by adults unknown.</p>\n<p>This is a marketing campaign aimed at turning public opinion on a topic that there's very little knowledge about. Wouldn't be the first time. Aside from a blitzkrieg of propaganda in various tabloids and a “partnership” with The Sun to really ramp things up with Conservatives favourite demographic, and one weird, slightly creepy PR stunt.</p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/government-encryption-whatsapp-phone-security-b1994758.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> leaked documents on all this</a>, M&amp;C Saatchi notes that “'most of the public have never heard' of end-to-end encryption, one presentation slide about the campaign states – “people can be easily swayed” on the issue.\" To that end, they recommend going for the ick factor, getting people to not think about privacy and just go for feeling repulsed in a more fact-free environment. And here's where it gets weird. The stunt will be to place a glass box somewhere in public, a high street or shopping mall or some such place, one supposes. In the glass box, The Home Office, with the blessing of an NSPCC and some other charities aimed around children's issues, will pay a child to be locked in the box with an adult male who will leer sexually at them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Inside the box, there are two actors; one child and one adult. Both strangers. The child sits playing on their smart phone. At the other end of the box, we see an adult sat on a chair also on their phone, typing away. ... The adult occasionally looks over at the child, knowingly. Intermittently through the day, the ‘privacy glass’ will turn on and the previously transparent glass box will become opaque. Passers by won’t be able to see what’s happening inside. In other words, we create a sense of unease by hiding what the child and adult are doing online when their interaction can’t be seen.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First, yuck. It sounds like something PETA would do, like when they hire a model to sit naked in a cage in an attempt to make people consider going vegan. Only it's worse, and involves a minor. It also makes you wonder what showbiz parent will think that's a good career move for their tween: Go sit in public somewhere while a strange guy you're confined with ogles at you for the day. For people who try to position themselves as interested in child protection, they have a strange way of showing it.</p>\n<p>There are lots of reasons a flailing government might want to detract from all its current scandals by looking for new boo scaries everywhere, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/59964656\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this campaign isn't doing that well</a>. But let's stick to the main point it's trying to make: child safety. So here it goes: <strong>Encryption keeps children safe.</strong> (note: it's not an age thing, it works the same for everyone). It keeps them safe when transmitting data on whatever network they need to access to use it. Keeps their communications from being profiled by myriad trackers that exist in the surveillance capitalist economy. The Home Office doesn't like <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple's implementation</a>. Who else doesn't? Third party data traders. Encrypted services mean when you call or text your child, there's a chance that stays between your family, like when you talk with them at home. Many families use WhatsApp, which does have strong encryption. They should be using <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a>: Strong encryption and a lot of other features to make sure your offspring's data isn't where it shouldn't be. Use it for your family while you can still get it in this country.</p>\n<p>The Plague Times have led to more than one school lockdown, when we had to suddenly share are WFH lives across the kitchen table with one or more children trying to navigate classes via a series of Zoom or Teams calls with their classes and doing homework via a number of SaaS platforms. A lot of us manage their clubs memberships, school fees, schedules, teacher reports and social  through websites with questionable user interface choices. One thing you want on your device and in those platforms carrying all that data is strong encryption. I'll take a wonky interface if I'm fairly certain my kid's itinerary isn't being captured mid-way through transmission across the series of connections that make up how communication networks work.</p>\n<p>Back-dooring encryption, or policy to weaknesses in it won't work for a number of reasons, it would make things worse and require a rabbit's warren of other dystopian policy choises. You'd also need to legislate a national internet and close access to foreign services that won't subject themselves to local laws, and legislate against tools such as VPNs. You'd need to organise a system for storing master-keys and accessing them in ways that won't be compromised by insider threats or foreign governments. And lots and lots of blocking. Like the blocking that should be keeping me from watching the show I'm watching right now because I don't subscribe to that service (hypothetically speaking).</p>\n<p>There are other places where governments try to ban privacy and instil this idea of \"#NoPlaceToHide\". You don't want to live in them. Some people go to great lengths to leave them and get asylum somewhere else. As much as Priti Patel attacks encryption, she likes to have a go at them, too... particularly when they're at sea.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of ways to increase protection of children, all of which this government doesn't want to do. Increase spending on social services, access to good information, better education, and all the things for which this Tory government has cut funding. Incorporate targeted content across something like the BBC, whose funding this government is also working on freezing. Fund better investigative policing tools and teams, which this government also doesn't want to do. Tax big corporations, inclusive of the tech giants utilising strong encryption, to fund these and many other things instead of continuing to let them dodge it. Facebook (Meta) will happily fight a government about encryption so long as it doesn't have to face it over taxes.</p>\n<p>So, there are a lot of solutions to the stated problem. The point of weakening or creating backdoors to encrypted systems isn't about safety, it's about what it's always been about; it's about control.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>More on this</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://neilzone.co.uk/2022/01/a-prohibition-on-end-to-end-encryption-could-leave-you-with-noplacetohide-and-thats-not-a-good-thing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A prohibition on end to end encryption could leave you with #NoPlaceToHide.

            "content_html": "<p class=\"dropcap\">Happy new year. It's a new year and I somehow feel obligated to make a blog post to mark that even though I kind of have writer's block and can't think of anything to write about. Fortunately, this is a blog, and doesn't really have to be about much anything.</p>\n<p>It's around this time of year I like to take stock of my online presence and various hard drives and see what to keep, delete, or wipe and repeat. One of the nice things about using a password manager and app-based 2FA is that you can keep a nice running list of all the online accounts you've got. <a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KeePassXC</a> tells me how many hundreds of accounts I have floating around. If you want to both strengthen your use of passwords and start and audit of all the places you have an account, set up a password manager, and as you use each account, reset the password to some random 32+ character monster you'll never remember, and keep a record of where you're going online at the same time. The best way to start with a password manager is to just set one up and go. Instead of trying to add all your accounts in one go (if you have a lot of them) just add them as you visit the websites. In about a month, you'll have the majority (if not all) of your important accounts. So there's a new year's PSA for you.</p>\n<h3>The website</h3>\n<p>I'm temporarily closing some buggy things. Closed the onion mirror of this blog and the onionshare contact form for a bit until I can make these things more stable. Will also be looking for a flat-site generator to replace Publii, which started strong, but the bugs are becoming kind of annoying. It edits kind of wonky. Select text to delete and it deletes the paragraph above. Weird. </p>\n<h3>Online accounts</h3>\n<p><strong>Delete: </strong>Amongst many things, Slack. A few years ago I went from 0 to 8 Slacks in just a couple of months, and I currently use 1 of them, and not even that frequently. The one I controlled was easy. As an administrator, I just deleted it. But depending on the version of Slack being used, you may or may not be able to simply opt out. To remove myself from some, I need to contact the administrator. On at least one, I'm sure they've gone AWOL. You shouldn't have to talk to anyone to remove yourself from an online service. Slack was supposed to put an end to emails. It just created a deluge of meaningless chatter. No new Slacks. And need to post in existing ones I want out. </p>\n<p><strong>Keep:</strong> From the collection of digital collateral to roll on with, I'll stick with Publii, the app I'm using to make this blog. It's still glitchy and unfinished, and I can't yet justify using a premium version of it until they make this one work right, but it's maybe the best open source tool for throwing a simple, flat website on the web. Publii, Github and a reasonable domain management service are all that are running this show. The only thing I'm paying for is the domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Wipe and repeat</strong>: I keep some Protonmail addresses, and will even add one to the contact page here soonish. Unless you're also chatting with it using a Protonmail account as well, I don't particularly rate it as greatly enhancing security, and the spam/junk filtering is crap. I do regular wipes of the account though, and some people still want to send an email.</p>\n<h3>Socials</h3>\n<p>I quite Facebook a couple of years back, and have not really missed it. In fact, it immediately made checking in on the web better. Am still in the metaverse via Insta and WhatsApp, but single-use apps are where its at. Quit more social sites, or understand why you're on them. Actually, here I recommend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1477313627598299137\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anil Dash's resources</a> on how to wipe your social accounts for new years and new starts. I'm just about to check out a Glitch app on how to \"KonMari\" Twitter followers <a href=\"https://glitch.com/~tokimeki-unfollow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, and highly recommend the process. I usually do this manually, but am happy to see something that makes the process more interesting.</p>\n<h3>2022 digital resolutions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Quit more.</strong> Close more accounts, and make my web more ephemeral. I tend to be a volatile user, but I create lots of accounts often just to see what the shiny looking thing does. My goal this year is to close more online things than I open. Quitting another one of the big companies is still on my list. I still have some Amazon and Google services running and would be happy to move off.</li>\n<li><strong>Blog more.</strong> I wrote maybe 6 things last year (no, I'm not counting). Blog shorter, care less about form and style and be a bit more creative and messy (if you can believe it). </li>\n<li><strong>Tech less.</strong> I've downsized my devices in the last couple of years, and could still do some more culling. Like everything else, each thing should be justifying its existence in the horde. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",
