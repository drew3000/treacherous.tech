            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    The true stories rarely have happy endings. I finished my journey through \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043-this-is-how-they-tell-me-the-world-ends\" target=\"_blank\">This is How They Tell Me the World Ends</a>\", a readable tour through the shady and yet still shadier parts of cyber weapons market by New York Times journalist Nicole Perlroth. It's not such a spoiler to let you know that we're all the canon fodder in the ongoing escalation of nation states to corner access on hacking tools that can allow them to disable their adversaries. But as someone who casually pays attention to the market of offensive tech, this book offers a staggering breadth of coverage, introducing a wide cast of players on all sides.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It's readable and fast paced and Perlroth has a relatable narrative voice and also makes for a good central character navigating from one technology nightmare to the next. She's good at avoiding the technical jargon where it's not needed and explaining it where it's unavoidable. I think her short-cuts to educating readers on what are sometimes really complicated topics are like fingernails on a chalkboard to experts in cyber security fields, but this book isn't aimed at them. And it's better for it.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I decided to read the book actually after catching some critical reviews by people more on the engineering side of technology. One thing they had in common aside from being male was they hadn't actually gotten that far through it. I wonder if even finished. It's fast paced and at time reads a bit like a spy thriller though with occasional reminders that it's all happening, and by the way, the controls that run all of our water, electricity, telecommunications and more are online and not that terribly secure.&nbsp;There's a lot of inside baseball in the early chapters about the New York Times and how it operates on these kinds of stories, and how it plays well, or doesn't play well, with others. the book starts off with her involvement in reporting on the Snowden leaks of NSA programs, and there's no shortage of snark about The Guardian. But that soon gives way to a world tour of various hacker communities, brokers of the unpatched holes in your mobile's operating system, and national security experts whose names you may not see in the papers very much because they're actually doing the work.&nbsp;To be honest, if the book can make a general audience more interested in these kinds of issues, then I think that's a good thing overall.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It's one of these books that I think I'll hit again with the highlighter and the PostIt notes. It was around page 137, in the chapter called \"The Kurd\" that I started folding corners of pages to return to.&nbsp; It's not that if I leave a book completely un-ravaged that it was a bad read, but the highest honour my nonfiction reads have are to be well worn, with ugly misshapen spines from being left open, creases in the corners from bookmarking and little semi-legible notes in the margins.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In a nutshell, everything's exploitable if you look hard enough, long enough. And there are governments that will pay a lot of money to obtain this. The Snowden leaks showed some of this and how the NSA and GSHQ exploited this. Later on, through Wikileaks and others, we've all been able to learn about hacking tools of the CIA. These tools are exploited by Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc. against targets ranging from political leaders, corporate giants like Jeff Bezos to investigative journalists and human rights investigators. And often, such as attacks that hit things the NHS, the rest of us.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    There are reasonable actions governments can take that governments can do, summarised in the books' closing. Don't run elections online. Patch software instead of hoarding these security holes for some potential use. Secure more infrastructure. Encourage people to use end to end encryption, or even set government limits on what's considered minimally secure instead of lobbying for back doors. Consider some kinds of rigorous standards for people put in places of high trust for securing the things we all use.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But it's kind of a trap. The book leaves the reader some good hints (turn on two-factor authentication, use strong passwords and a password manager, you). However you're left with the understanding of this other angle of the complexity trap in which we find ourselves stuck. If you want to scale systems that growing numbers of people want if not need (clean water, regular power, food and the transportation systems that move it, the ability to call one another) then you're going to centralise and develop control systems that enable all that to reach people. The place where all that sits is more-or-less the place where this blog sits: online. You can take it back off again. All this combined digital infrastructure that runs civilisation exists where it does for a reason. It works there for the job we want it to do.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The book focuses a lot on the 0day market. These are exploits that the makers of software don't know exist (and have had zero days to fix, get it?). It's an expensive market as these are harder to find than the loads of exploits that just exist because so many systems we rely on use outdated operating systems or built with old or unsupported code. The book gets into both of these, plus the human side of things, such as how social networks can game human perceptions for political ends. But the 0day industry is maybe the most symbolic of the whole trade. Bug hunters can either get paid thousands to turn them over to the companies running them, or tens if not hundreds of thousands to sell them on to brokers that will sell them to governments for millions. Companies can't compete with that. I don't think some even really want to.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    So read this one but there's a warning: You may start to appreciate the off-grid types in new ways.\n  </p>",

We've already seen it happen in 2021. [In 2019]. In 2020 there were <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/global-5\" target=\"_blank\">83 documented shutdowns</a> in the world. A bit down from the <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/02/KeepItOn-2019-report-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">213 shutdowns that happened in in 2019</a>, but still on the upward trajectory. There were 33 in 2018 and 25 the year before that.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I'll be moving on to include some resources on other kinds of internet censorship and how to work around it. The goal overall is to keep it end-user focused, though may add a post on the bigger, more involved projects. The other goal is to experiment with a pretty easy and sturdy way of publishing on the web.\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"what-the-detour-is-made-with\">\n      What 'The Detour' is made with...\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    As I've noted in earlier posts on this blog, I'm interested in simple, sturdy and secure ways to publish online. Sites that don't need databases or login credentials. Site's with minimal code bases to maintain. I'm publishing this site using Publii and Github pages. The work happens through an app on my computer and then spits pages at a site hosted on Github. So The Detour is an experiment along these lines.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I'm a <a href=\"https://standardnotes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Notes</a> user. It's an extendable, open source text editor that's good for taking quick notes, editing, and storing information. It's open source, and can sync across devices and back-up in the cloud of your choice with strong encryption. I&nbsp;recently noticed that it has a simple blogging function that publishes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://listed.to/\" target=\"_blank\">Listed.to</a>.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It's not an incredibly sophisticated publishing tool, but really easy for anyone to start, and the model is incredibly attractive if you wanted to extend it to a small team who could submit, review edit and publish using Standard Notes already existing encrypted sharing functions. It's much better than leaving unfinished drafts on a public website, or having to keep persistent connections to a web server while doing the research, writing and editing.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    Howard Dean was the first American political candidate to use the internet as a vehicle to run a campaign. And his team was on to something. In 2002 his team working on the Democratic nomination for the 2004 presidential election was pioneering the things that are all now bog-standard: campaign website, online donation pages and blogs. He also realised the purpose behind it all: You convert people into communities, not voters. Votes are a bi-product of generating communities. And people want to believe. Meetup.com was new, and the campaign used it to get people to throw house parties, or find groups to hang out with at the local <em>TGI Fridays</em> or whatever. The whole thing was geared toward meeting, bonding and agreeing with one another. Fun. It didn't work in the end. But it was a first iteration. Every major political campaign since built on the model, and there's now no such thing as a successful campaign that can't find its roots in it.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You could plot a course from Dean's use of nascent social media to how it had been used to span a beyond-control horde of MAGAheads storming the capitol 18 years later.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wylie\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Wiley's</a> book <em>Mindf*ck</em> plots the data scraping consultant's career exploiting demographic data and the social web to micro-target voters based on personas, starting with the Liberal Party in Canada before taking his trade to the Obama campaign and then on to the Liberal Democrats in UK before helping out both the UK referendum to quit the EU and the campaign to elect Donald Trump in the U.S. The supply chain of tactics is clear here, from friendly liberal Canadians to resurgent proto-fascist movements in the span of a decade or less.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    People like to call&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz\">Aaron Swartz</a> \"The Internet's Own Boy.\" It's a good story. He was instrumental in a lot of things that have made the internet useful, educational, fun and open. At least the parts of the internet that are those things. And he was prosecuted and endlessly hounded for it. We can call the 45th president's single term the internet's own regime. It used the same tools, created communities, leveraged social media data to target messaging, and all together hit a nerve. So when people talk to you about the marvels of the internet age, sure it's pretty cool. We've created awesome ways for people to connect, work and socialise. And not an insignificant number of them can be instigated to use those tools to try to destroy democracy sometimes. This iteration failed.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Hello friend,</p>\n<p>Happy 2021 and thanks for keeping up with the ever evolving progression of this experiment. 2020 was the dumpster fire that gave more flame than than anyone could have expected, or would have asked for. Toward the end of 2019, I'd ditched <a href=\"https://wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wordpress</a> for <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugo</a> and went on to created all of 3 blog posts. It was an exhausting year. Working on other people's problems was more than enough. I mostly ignored my own. </p>\n<p>This year, I'm starting with <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii</a>, which is an open source app that generates flat-sites. It's part of my continuing search for website publishing systems that securely keep the back end (the place where people create the content) away from the front end (where people show the content), are light on the server, and easy on the user. Wordpress has become bloated and too much of an attack target. The CMS is borderline adware and the \"community\" of developers is becoming more of a flea market of poorly constructed design themes and plugins that are patchy, bloated and hackable.<a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\" title=\"publii\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p>Hugo was all right. Create and edit posts in a text file and then with a few commands new content is up on the website. It's easy to secure, can run blazingly fast websites and be hosted nearly anywhere, lowering costs amazingly. Ticked a lot of my static-site requirements. Except one. It isn't for end users, or at least how I define them. An end user is someone who wants to open an app, type their content, hit save or publish and see it on the site. Wordpress does this, just horribly from every other point of view. But it's what people expect. Hugo, <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"https://scotch.io/tutorials/top-10-static-site-generators-in-2020#toc-1-gatsby\">Gatsby</a> and the like are for people who want to endlessly tinker with code and templates and refine their git workflows. They just move the complexities elsewhere.  So, I'm trying out Publii, which is in an app. It's doing a lot of things those other static site generators are doing, but the user doesn't need to see them or carry out each operation. It also opens with a wysiwyg editor that authors will expect, and somewhat obvious settings and configuration options. There seems to be not much of a developer or designer community to speak of, though.</p>\n<p>So like each time I do this, I start out minimal, and wipe what came before. I believe in the permeable web, the volatile one. The web that forgets. The non-centralised, federated services one. Sure, we need that archiving internet, the one with tracking and accountability for our governments, leaders (be they political, corporate, religious or social) and all these caches, backups and searchable systems that keep the receipts. For a lot of the rest of us, though, we need one that is more like a sand mandala. Something that gives us the privacy, security, and most importantly, the space to experiment and either maintain, iterate or wipe: no harm; no foul.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the inverse is more commonly the case. Kids say dumb things on Instagram and it chases them into the starts of their careers. Videos meant for one set of eyes get immortalised for all eyes for all time. Humans aren't designed for the web we have. It's not sense in blaming the user. It makes as much sense as blaming jellyfish for beaching themselves on the outgoing tide. The situation moves faster than our survival instincts. We should still be sitting somewhere in a savannah staring into the middle distance with an expression that implies more significant thought than what's really going on. Parts of our brains have developed a world that other parts of our brains can'd deal with. So cut yourself some slack. You aren't even supposed to be here today. None of us are.</p>\n<p>We're still calling the site Treacherous Tech, because the it still suits the overall point: The promises of a gloriously interconnected world of social media, IoT sex toys and door bells that can spy on the comings and goings in front of your house all come with ToS catches. There are stings attached, monetisation efforts and ever expanding threat surface. We inflict  all this on ourselves in order to have dopamine rushes from people clicking <span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">♥️</span> on our selfies and to get garlic peelers on the same day we click the order button. Technology keeps its promises, so be sure you know what it's promising.</p>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>I already prefer the editing interface of publii. It's a little buggy and unfinished in parts. It feels more like a word processor than a CMS. I like that the drafts are mine, here on this local machine, before I publish them on some server somewhere, even in draft mode. I like that I don't need to launch the terminal and manually chug through git processes just to make each blog post. It's got a slightly wonky interface and I don't think all the buttons are labeled that well, and I think it could benefit from some usability love, but early days.</p>\n<p>I'm using the default theme this CMS comes with (there aren't many alternatives), so don't expect much on that front. I don't care much how it looks. It's just a thing to write into. A bit more FOSS and self-hosted than Medium. A bit less faff than a Wordpress or Drupal or Hugo site. I think it needs work, but it is definitely suitable for a single-person blog. It's kind of the slacker option.</p>\n<p>It's a new year, and I'm taking the easy route. There's enough going on with a pandemic, a Brexit, some chump in the White House who can't take a hint. Another year or so in doors. Go easy on yourself, too.</p>\n<p>Happy new year,</p>\n<p>Yours truly.</p>",
